Many of these sites will auto logout when you navigate away or when a certain amount of time has passed. For the script to function properly, your credentials must be saved to your browser and autofilled on the login pages of these sites. 
Many of these sites will also have captchas that need to be solved in the process of claiming the daily bonus. You will need to have a captcha solver plugin installed on your browser.
Zula will require manual login before running the script for the first time. Then the script will keep the session alive to avoid being automatically logged out.
